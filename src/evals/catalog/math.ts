// SCAFFOLD STATUS — not a trusted baseline.
// Review of 12 September 2026 (src/agents/math/archive/REVIEW-2026-09-12.md) established that a
// `requiredTools` name check cannot show which mode ran, with what inputs, or whether the
// calculation actually succeeded, and that literal `mustInclude` strings can reject
// mathematically correct LaTeX. Treat results as development signal only until richer tool
// evidence and a mathematics-aware scorer are agreed with the shared evaluation owner.
//
// Gold answers were checked against the SEAB and MOE documents on 29 September 2026
// (src/agents/math/runs/2026-09-29-gold-review.md). Where a correct reply can be written
// several ways (1/2 or \frac{1}{2}), the literal check is dropped and the judge decides,
// until the shared scorer can test mathematical equivalence.
//
// Eval v2 (5 October 2026) adds generated cases from math-generated.ts, whose answers are
// computed by code. Ids starting math-holdout- are held out: never tune against them.
